# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
Vanderbilt University Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp, jun 2021

Objective: Help Louise to create a campain for her play "Fever"

Findings:
-Failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns. 
-Louise is asking for more than twice the average successful Kickstarter goal, so this isn't great news for her campaign. 
-The mean campaign goal is around £4,000. 
-Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
-May is a good Month to start a crowdfounding campain.
-The theater crowdfounding campains fare well in comparison with other type of campains.


Conclusions:
-After an exaustive analysis of the Kickstarter crowdfounding data at hand with the help of pivot tables, graphic charts and statistics we arrive to the conclusion that Louise should try to get her play produced for less than £4,000. 

-The following graphic chart shows a representation of Goals and Pledges that sustain the conclusion we arrived to:
