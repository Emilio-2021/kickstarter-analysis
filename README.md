# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
### Purpose
This challenges will provide an opportunity for me to build on the skills that I have learned in the module
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The instructions were very clear practically and an straight forward process, I was able to refresh what I learned previously and use sorting on the Outcomes field

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
A new function was introduced here to fulfill this challenge, the criteria was not working for me in the way the instructions present them so I create three hidden fields with the required criteria and one visible field using the "concatenate" to be able to make the graphic chart the one expected

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I made use of the literature for excel to succeed on the second challenge
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
# 1-The projects created on May have a better opportunity of success
# 2-December is not a good month to start a crowdfounding
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
 Projects with a lower budget have more possibilities to get fulfilled
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
 At the moment I dont have an opinion about what might be considered a dataset limitation 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
 The box and whisker plot is a nice graph to have, it gives a great insight about the Outliners
