# Kickstarting with Excel  
An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.  
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends Vanderbilt University Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp, jun 2021  
## Overview of Project  
Help Louise to create a campain for her play "Fever" and show her how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.  
### Purpose
This challenges will provide an opportunity for me to build on the skills that I have learned in the module
## Analysis and Challenges
with the use of Excel we were able to find that failed campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful campaigns, Louise is asking for more than twice the average successful goal so this isn't great news for her campaign, the mean campaign goal is around £4,000 and half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.  

-The following graphic chart shows a representation of Goals and Pledges that sustain the conclusion we arrived to:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date  
Through the use of a Pivot Table and chart I was able to determine that projects started by May have more opportunity to succeed in comparison with projects that start in other month.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Through the use of a Goal list I found that projects with small budgets have more possibilities to reach their goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The instructions were very clear and straight forward, I was able to make use of what I learned.  
## Results  
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?  
	1-The projects created on May have a better opportunity of success  
	2-December is not a good month to start a crowdfounding  
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?  
	Projects with a lower budget have more possibilities to get fulfilled  
- What are some limitations of this dataset?  
	At the moment I dont have an opinion about what might be considered a dataset limitation   
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?  
	The box and whisker plot is a nice graph to have for this project
